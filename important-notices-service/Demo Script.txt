Hello and welcome, Here I will present a series of short videos showing the current status of the Seeker Replacement project, specifically looking at the My Money Module. The new platform is using Angular JS for the UI and Spring MVC + Hibernate to provide the micro services that the UI Consumes.

These videos will give you good look at the progress we have made so far, and what kinds of things to expect from the next generation of the TriNet Platform.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy it.

TAX WITHHOLDING ID: 00001005473 7T1

Lets begin with the Tax Withholding component of the My Money Module.

Effective date for any changes is automatically one day in the future.

Here the user can set up the withholding for both Federal and State tax

The user can launch their current home state tax forms such as W-4

Changing the Federal tax automatically increases the state, but not the other way around.

Let start with the Direct Deposit component of My Money.

This component lets the user configure how their pay is distributed across different bank accounts. 

It provides a graphical visualization of their last paycheck, and uses the donut to show how this amount was distributed across each of the accounts.

Change Next Pay Check amount in case the user wants to create some scenarios based on different earnings etc.
